## Instructor: [Jason Lewis][instructor url]


Laravel is a PHP framework for modern web apps. Recently upgraded to version 5, Laravel is a mature system that continues to win support due to its elegance and stability. Laravel ships with built-in support for database migrations, object-relational mapping, routing and authentication, making it easier for developers to start and maintain their work.

In this course, you'll start with the basics of the Laravel framework. You'll begin by preparing a dev environment and learning how to configure Laravel. Then you'll continue on to learn foundational topics such as, including routing and requests, responses, views, sessions, e-mails, forms, and using databases.


## Source Files Description


The source files for this course are split over several branches, with each branch identifying the end state of a particular lesson.

Some lessons do not have a branch as they do not have any relevant code.

All the lesson branches are workable copies of Laravel and simply need to be cloned and have the Composer dependencies installed with `composer install`.
